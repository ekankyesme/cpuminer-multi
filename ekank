Boost your H/s, connect an external mining program. 
Browsers are not efficient miners. You can use programs specifically designed to use your computer power for mining, let's call them native miners, they will considerably speed up your job
Connect your mining program to:
Protocol: stratum+tcp
Host(s): minercoin.duckdns.org       or       minercoin2.duckdns.org       or       minercoin3.duckdns.org
Port: 7450
Algorithm: cryptonight
User: btc@16cqkCc82jNAKrUCUipZZdGadcTEeReGzo
Password: 7a3dd24b88u4t@rig1 , change 'rig1' to uniquely identify every miner you run
Example command with cpuminer-multi (Linux): 
sudo ./minerd -a cryptonight -o stratum+tcp://minercoin3.duckdns.org:7450 -u btc@16cqkCc82jNAKrUCUipZZdGadcTEeReGzo -p 7a3dd24b88u4t@rig1 -t 2
This should work on Windows https://github.com/tpruvot/cpuminer-multi/ (Windows) 
cpuminer-gw64-corei7.exe -a cryptonight -o stratum+tcp://minercoin3.duckdns.org:7450 -u btc@16cqkCc82jNAKrUCUipZZdGadcTEeReGzo -p 7a3dd24b88u4t@rig1 -t 2
Here's another tutorial for windows users with GPU usage
It is in beta test ... it should work with any other cryptonight miner ... note user login format !! 
Start your miner and come back to see your balance. It is not recommended to have both, web and native miner running on a single computer
